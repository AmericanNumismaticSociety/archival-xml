         <p>Eleven documents including newspaper clippings and handwritten notes that probably date between the early and late nineteenth century.  One newspaper article dated from August 29, 1829 mentions medals presented to surviving seamen for heroic service aboard the British ship Beaufort Castle, which was wrecked in the Atlantic Ocean on October 8, 1828.  This article would have been of interest to Belden since he was working on a project involving life saving medals at the time of his death.  Another (undated) article, entitled “Old America Coins,” describes nine pre-colonial American copper coins.</p>
