         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         <p>Undated letter signed “Marie” on royal letterhead (Maison de S.M. La Reine). Appears to be the signature of Princess Marie Bonaparte, later known as Princess George of Greece and Denmark. Signature comparisons to two verified samples (copies with letter) appear to be similar to the bold signature in the letter.  Addressed to “My dear Loë,” the writer expresses her enthusiasm at a prospective meeting with the Norwebs, particularly Emery May. In keeping with a head of state, Princess Marie befittingly observes that the Norwebs’ visit might aid her “in the making of a great friendship between our two countries.” R. Henry and Emery May Norweb, having married in Paris in October 1917, spent four years there attached to the American Embassy, from 1917 until 1921. Presumably, this letter was written during that period.  It is not known whether the meeting between the Norwebs and Princess Marie ever took place.</p>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Princess Marie Bonaparte (1882-1962) was a French author and psychoanalyst. She was the great-grandniece of Emperor Napoleon I of France. In 1907 in Paris, she married Prince George of Greece and Denmark and was thereafter officially known as Princess George of Greece and Denmark. Marie was closely linked with Sigmund Freud whom she consulted for treatment of what she described as frigidity and whose escape from Nazi Germany she later helped to arrange. She practiced psychoanalysis until her death in 1962.</p>
