         <p>Edgar H. Adams (1868-1940) of Bayville, Oyster Bay, and Brooklyn, New York, was a numismatic scholar, author, and collector who produced, among other works, reference guides to
				territorial and private gold coins. He also coauthored, with William H. Woodin, the book United States Pattern, Trial, and Experimental Pieces, a standard reference work on pattern
				coins. He served as editor of The Numismatist, the monthly journal of the American Numismatic Association, wrote a numismatic column for the New York Sun newspaper, and was a
				co-founder of the New York Numismatic Club (1908).</p>
