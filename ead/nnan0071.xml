         <p>Kenneth W. Lee (1907-1980) was the author of California Gold Dollars, Half Dollars, Quarter Dollars (1970 &amp; 1979), an updating of California Gold, Quarters-Halves-Dollars: a
				Descriptive List of Privately Issued, Interesting and Historical Coins of Small Denominations (1932), which was written by his father, Edward (Ed) Melvin Lee (1871-1943). Kenneth was
				born in Glendale, California, and was a graduate of the University of Southern California. He worked briefly in advertising before joining his father in the coin and medal business in
				1930. He became a member of the American Numismatic Association in 1932, the American Numismatic Society in 1944, and was one of the organizers of the California State Numismatic
				Association in 1947.</p>

         <p>There is no record of the custodial history of the photographs between the time they were produced and used by Kenneth W. Lee for his book California Gold and the time they were donated
				to the ANS by Anthony Terranova in 1996. The notebook was purchased by Harry W. Bass Jr. from the Kenneth W. Lee library sale (Kolbe, June 12-13, 1981, lot 612) and kept as part of his
				library until it was purchased for the ANS in 2000.</p>

         <p>Three-ring bound notebook containing pages from Edward (Ed) Melvin Lee’s book California Gold, Quarters-Halves-Dollars (1932) that have been heavily annotated by Edward and then by his
				son, Kenneth. This would result in Kenneth’s updating of his father’s work with his own book, California Gold Dollars, Half Dollars, Quarter Dollars (1970-1979). The notebook may have
				been continually updated from approximately 1932 to 1969. In it are detailed descriptions, diagnostic notes, pieces reported but not seen, pedigrees of known specimens, auction
				appearances, and other notes. Items found loose in the notebook include a letter from dealer B. Max Mehl offering Edward five rare California gold dollars from the Waldo Newcomer
				collection, along with rubbings of the coins (1932), and a certificate of copyright from the Library of Congress for Edward’s book (1932). Also present are photographic negatives and
				contact proof sheets of Kenneth’s collection of octagonal and round fractional gold coins, including Kroll hoard pieces, in twenty-five cent, fifty cent, and one dollar denominations
				(1979).</p>
