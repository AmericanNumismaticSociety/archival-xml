Weinman (1915-2003) was born in New York City.</abstract><p>American medallic artist Robert A. Weinman (1915-2003) was born in New York City. He was the youngest son of American sculptor Adolph Alexander Weinman (1870-1952), who gained fame in the numismatic field for designs such as the Winged Liberty, or Mercury, dime and Walking Liberty half dollar. Weinman served an apprenticeship with his father for ten years, during which time he also attended the Art Student’s League and the National Academy of Design. He was a member of the Army Air Corps from 1942 to 1945, where he learned the art of photography. In 1948 he opened his own studio in New York City and then moved his business to Bedford, New York, in 1972. He won the National Sculpture Society’s Bennett Prize in 1952 for the sports medals he designed for the National Collegiate Athletic Association. In 1964 he received the American Numismatic Society’s J. Sanford Saltus award, a silver medal designed by his father, who was himself a recipient of the award in 1920. He designed the 1974 medal of the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration and received the Numismatic Art Award for Excellence in Medallic Sculpture in 1975. He was a past and honorary president of the National Sculpture Society, receiving their Gold Medal in 1997. Throughout his lifetime, he designed more than one hundred medals, including works for New York University, the American Institute of Architects, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He retired to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in 1988.</p></biogHist><occupation><term vocabularySource="http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300025337">medalists</term></occupation><occupation><term vocabularySource="http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300386299">coin engravers</term></occupation></description><relations><cpfRelation xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://viaf.org/viaf/4850856" xlink:arcrole="rel:childOf" xlink:role="foaf:Person"><relationEntry>Weinman, Adolph A.
