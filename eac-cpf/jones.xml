Jones (1864 or 5-1961) of Jamestown, New York, was a founding member of the Chautauqua County Coin, Stamp, and Curio Club in 1930 and is listed as member number six of the American Numismatic Association (ANA), which was officially organized in 1891 and reorganized in 1899. He was also a member of the Chautauqua Historical Society. Born in Sweden, he came to the United States when he was one year old. In 1941 he sold over 5,000 coins from his collections, which he had been accumulating for nearly fifty years, to the American Numismatic Society. Jones collected coins from all over the world and built his holdings through his dealings with other collectors, such as Henry H. Howorth, C. Wyllys Betts, J.W. Bastow, and Julius Meili. In the 1930s and 1940s he wrote articles in the ANA magazine The Numismatist on topics pertaining to United States collecting, such as the 1804 dollar, postage stamps, fractional currency, and the 1856 flying eagle cent.</p></biogHist><occupation><term vocabularySource="http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300025063">engineers</term></occupation></description><relations><cpfRelation xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://viaf.org/viaf/157729460" xlink:arcrole="org:memberOf" xlink:role="org:Organization"><relationEntry>American Numismatic Association</relationEntry></cpfRelation></relations></cpfDescription></eac-cpf>
